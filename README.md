# Candlestick Chart with Order Blocks

## Description

This Python script generates a candlestick chart with additional order blocks for a financial dataset. The candlestick chart displays the open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices for a given time period, and certain candlesticks are marked with colored blocks based on specific conditions.

## Original Code

The script is a rewritten version of an undisclosed code used to create candlestick charts with order blocks for financial analysis PineScript.

## Functionality

1. The script generates example financial data containing timestamp, open, high, low, and close prices using the Pandas and NumPy libraries.

2. The data is processed and modified to identify bullish and bearish order blocks based on certain conditions.

3. Bullish order blocks are marked with blue blocks on the chart, while bearish order blocks are marked with red blocks.

4. The script plots the candlestick chart using the Matplotlib library. Candlestick colors on the chart represent different patterns identified in the financial data.

5. The script also marks specific lines on the chart for the identified bullish and bearish order blocks.

## Instructions

1. Install the required libraries if not already installed: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

2. Run the script, and it will generate an example candlestick chart with order blocks based on the provided financial data.

## Dependencies

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

- Ensure the required libraries are installed in the Python environment.
- Run the script using any Python IDE or from the terminal.
- The candlestick chart with order blocks will be displayed.
